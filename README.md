# üîó **LLMChainFusion**

This repository aims to develop a comprehensive collection of use cases for the LangChain framework. Our goal is to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with LangChain's interface, enabling seamless development and deployment of natural language processing (NLP) applications.

*** [Newest update] Check capacity of local GPU memory before building applications with a specific model.

* Nvidia NIM endpoints to build applications with Llama 3.1-405B.

* Langchain Ollama with latest Meta model [Llama 3.1](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_1/MODEL_CARD.md).


[OPTIONAL] You do not need to download model manually. Ollma code can download automatically. But you can download specific pretrained models compatible with your machine by your own as following:
- Llama 3.1 (8B params): ```ollama run llama3.1 ```
- Llama 3.1 (70B params):  ```ollama run llama3.1:70b```
- Llama 3.1 (405B params): ```ollama run llama3.1:405b```

For more information, check out official [Ollama repo](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md).

## Quick Installs [MANDATORY]

With pip:
```bash
pip install torch pynvml ollama
# If used Nvidia service.
pip install langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints 
```

With conda:
```bash
conda install ollama -c conda-forge
# If used Nvidia service.
conda install langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints -c conda-forge 
```
